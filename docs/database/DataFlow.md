# Typical Data Flow

This document describes the typical data flow in the TestMaster application.

## Project Creation and Setup

1. **Create Project**
   - User creates a new project
   - System automatically adds the creator as project owner
   - Project is added to the projects table

2. **Add Users to Project**
   - Project owner adds users to the project
   - Users are assigned roles (admin, editor, viewer)
   - Entries are added to the project_users table

3. **Configure Project Parameters**
   - Project-specific parameters are set
   - Parameters are stored in project_parameters

## Test Case Management

1. **Create Test Cases**
   - Users with appropriate permissions create test cases
   - Test case details are stored in the test_cases table
   - Test steps are added to the test_steps table

2. **Organize Test Cases**
   - Test cases can be organized in collections or suites
   - Parent-child relationships can be established between test cases
   - Tags and requirements are associated with test cases

3. **Create Test Data**
   - For data-driven tests, test data is defined
   - Stored as JSON in the test_data column

## Test Planning and Execution

1. **Create Test Plans**
   - Test plans are created by selecting test cases
   - Test plans are stored in the test_plans table

2. **Create Test Cycles**
   - Test cycles are created based on test plans
   - Environment and build information is specified
   - Test cycles are stored in the test_cycles table

3. **Execute Tests**
   - Tests are executed within a test cycle
   - Results are recorded in the test_executions table
   - Step results are recorded in the execution_steps table

4. **Report Defects**
   - Defects found during execution are reported
   - Defects are linked to test executions
   - Defects are stored in the defects table

## Reporting and Analysis

1. **View Execution Results**
   - Execution results are aggregated and displayed
   - Statistics are calculated (pass/fail rates, etc.)

2. **Track Defects**
   - Defects are tracked through their lifecycle
   - Status updates are recorded

3. **Analyze Requirements Coverage**
   - Requirements coverage is calculated
   - Gaps in testing are identified

## Data Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of testing data follows this pattern:

1. Project setup
2. Test case design 
3. Test planning
4. Test execution
5. Defect tracking
6. Reporting and analysis
7. Archiving or maintenance

## Database Triggers and Automations

Several automations exist in the data flow:

1. **handle_new_project trigger** - Adds creator as project owner
2. **update_updated_at_column trigger** - Updates timestamps automatically
3. **Security policies** - Restrict data access based on project membership

## API Interactions

API interactions with the database typically include:

1. **Read operations** - Fetching data for display
2. **Write operations** - Creating and updating entities
3. **Search operations** - Finding entities based on criteria
4. **Batch operations** - Bulk operations on multiple entities
